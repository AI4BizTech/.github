## AI4mathSci's Mission
AI4MathSci is a development group focusing on advanced mathematical problems solving with agentic workflow powered by LLM APIs and mathematical tools. 

Automating advanced mathematical problem-solving serves as a cornerstone for streamlining complex problem-solving across various business and engineering domains. These fields heavily rely on sophisticated mathematical tools as their foundation. Our first application project is from the **supply chain management** area, we will start from inventory simulation and demand forecasting, and gradually roll out other sub-systems from that area.
