## AI4mathSci's Mission
AI4MathSci is a development group focusing on advanced mathematical problems solving with agentic workflow powered by LLM APIs and mathematical tools. 

Automating advanced mathematical problem-solving serves as a cornerstone for streamlining complex problem-solving across various business and engineering domains. These fields heavily rely on sophisticated mathematical tools as their foundation. Our first application project is from the **supply chain management** area, we will start from inventory simulation and demand forecasting, and gradually roll out other sub-systems from that area.

## LLMs' and Agentic Workflow's Role in Supply Chain Management
LLMs and Agentic Workflow can help automate some of the time-consuming tasks in supply chain management, boosting efficiency and make the system more accessible through human language. Examples include but not limited to:

1. **Translating Users' Needs into Formal Queries**
- Users can query the system in human language, such as “Which products had stockout and at which warehouses last week?" or “What was the number or percentage of instances last month when the total shipping cost exceeded $50,000?” etc.
- LLMs can translate such queries into formal queries into the system to get executed

2. **Generating Reports for Users' Queries**
- LLMs can generate report based on the outcome from executing the queries
